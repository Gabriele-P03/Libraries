# JPL #
A C++ project composed of several modules which are independent by each other. There are some of them, i.e. Common Modules (CM), which are used by other ones; they are marked as "CM".
<br><br>
All modules have own README.md which is only a brief documentation. If you are interested into the full doc of it, each of them has a folder called "doc" which contains relative documentation generated by Doxygen.
<br><br><br>
There's a chromatic protocol in order to understand the documentation of the whole project:

# Dictionary

>## CM  (*Common Module*)
>> A module which can be included by other modules

>## OI (*Optional Induction*)
>> It is performed when a module is able to improve its performance with the help of another one (module), but if the latter could not be loaded correctly, program will not exit with failure. The module which include will keep running such as it had never asked help to the other one

>## OMI (*Optional Mutual Induction*)
>> As the OI, but the two modules include each others. OMI can be succeded even only by one-verse, i.e. module A includes correctly B, but B was not able to include A.
Goddamit! Fucking forward declaration! What a Hell!
